# Quack

Quack is a doom clone that will be retextured to feature ducks and anything related to ducks. The purpose is a fun project to learn more about using C# scripts in Unity.

If you load the project, it is unfinished currently because the tutorial I was following stopped making tutorials. The rest of project will require me trying to finish the game on my own with different sources, so it may be a while.

If you wanna see my progress, you can take a look at my trello board [here!](https://trello.com/b/A18WEWgQ/quack-doom-clone)
